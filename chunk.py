# chunk.py

# ideas:
"""
Each chunk should have a certain amount of tiles
Lets assume a 1000x1000 screen size
If each tile is 10x10, that means the screen will have 100x100 tiles
If we make each chunk 10x10 tiles, each chunk will contain 100 tiles (and be 1/10 of the screen in length and width)

So, we should be able to load in all of the chunks within a certain range of the player (instead of loading in every single chunk each time)
