        Most likely, there will have to be a function to draw chunks in proximity to player
        It will have to take player object in
        And only draw the chunks in a predefined proximity to the player
        
        Note: may have to keep track of which chunks are close if looping through all chunks takes too long
        Note: we are going to want to render 11 chunks on x and y at all times (thats all we need to render)
